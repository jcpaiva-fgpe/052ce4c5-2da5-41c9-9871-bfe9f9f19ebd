<div class="sur_static"><img src="/surimg/pioneer.png" class="sur_img_res"><span>Pioneer</span></div>
Pioneers question the adequacy of contemporary digital and pedagogical practices, of which they themselves are Leaders. They are concerned about the constraints or drawbacks of these practices and driven by the impulse to innovate education even further. Pioneers experiment with highly innovative and complex digital technologies and/or develop novel pedagogical approaches. Pioneers are a unique and rare species. They lead innovation and are a role model for younger teachers.

<div class="sur_static"><img src="/surimg/leader.png" class="sur_img_res"><span>Leader</span></div>
Leaders have a consistent and comprehensive approach to using digital technologies to enhance pedagogic and professional practices. They rely on a broad repertoire of digital strategies from which they know how to choose the most appropriate for any given situation. They continuously reflect on and further develop their practices. Exchanging with peers, they keep updated on new developments and ideas. They are a source of inspiration for others, to whom they pass on their expertise.

<div class="sur_static"><img src="/surimg/expert.png" class="sur_img_res"><span>Expert</span></div>
Experts use a range of digital technologies confidently, creatively and critically to enhance their professional activities. They purposefully select digital technologies for particular situations, and try to understand the benefits and drawbacks of different digital strategies. They are curious and open to new ideas, knowing that there are many things they have not tried out yet. They use experimentation as a means of expanding, structuring and consolidating their repertoire of strategies. Experts are the backbone of any educational organisation when it comes to innovating practice.

Integrators experiment with digital technologies in a variety of contexts and for a range of purposes, integrating them into many of their practices. They creatively use them to enhance diverse aspects of their professional engagement. They are eager to expand their repertoire of practices. They are, however, still working on understanding which tools work best in which situations and on fitting digital technologies to pedagogic strategies and methods. Integrators just need some more time for experimentation and reflection, complemented by collaborative encouragement and knowledge exchange to become Experts.

Explorers are aware of the potential of digital technologies and are interested in exploring them to enhance pedagogical and professional practice.

Newcomers are aware of the potential of digital technologies for enhancing pedagogical and professional practice.
However, they have had very little contact with digital technologies and use them mainly for lesson preparation,
administration or organisational communication. Newcomers need guidance and encouragement to expand their repertoire and to apply their existing digital competence in the pedagogical realm.

When designing learning and assessment activities, I use a range of different digital and immersive technologies, which I adapt and adjust to account for different needs, levels, speeds and preferences. When sequencing and implementing learning activities, I allow for different learning pathways, levels and speeds and flexibly adapt my strategies to changing circumstances or needs. 
I use a range of technologies to create a relevant, rich and effective immersive learning environment, e.g. by addressing different sensory channels, learning styles and strategies, by methodologically varying activity types and group compositions. I reflect on how effective the teaching strategies employed are in increasing learner engagement and active learning.

I understand how access to immersive technology creates divides and how studentsâ€™ social and economic conditions have an impact on
the way technology is used. I ensure that all students have access to the immersive technologies I use. I am aware that compensatory digital and immersive technologies can be used for learnersâ€™ in need of special support (e.g. learners with physical or mental constraints; learners with learning disorders).
I select and use some learning activities, e.g. quizzes or games, that allow learners to proceed at different speeds, select different levels of difficulty and/or repeat activities previously not solved adequately.
I put learnersâ€™ active use of immersive technologies at the centre of the instructional process. I choose the most appropriate tool for fostering learner active engagement in a given learning context or for a specific learning objective.

I understand the importance of ensuring equal access to the immersive technologies used for all students. I am aware that digital technologies can hinder or improve accessibility.
I am aware that digital and immersive technologies can support differentiation and personalisation, e.g. by providing activities at different levels and speeds.
I use immersive technologies to visualise and explain new concepts in a motivating and engaging way. I employ learning activities which are motivating and engaging, e.g. games, quizzes.

I am afraid that the use of immersive technologies in teaching will make it even more difficult for already disadvantaged students to
participate and keep up with the others.
I do not know how immersive technologies can help me offer personalised learning opportunities.
I only very rarely, if at all, use immersive technologies to motivate or engage learners.
